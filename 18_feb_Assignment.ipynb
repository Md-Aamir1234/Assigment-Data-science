    "#2. Message Format: REST typically uses lightweight data exchange formats like JSON or XML, while SOAP messages are always in XML format.\n",
    "#3. Complexity: REST is simpler and requires less configuration than SOAP, which can make it faster and easier to develop and use. SOAP can be more complex and may require more time and expertise to implement.\n",
    "#4. Performance: REST is generally faster and more efficient than SOAP, as it uses lightweight message formats and relies on fewer network resources. SOAP, on the other hand, can be slower and less efficient due to its use of XML and more complex message structure.\n",
    "#5. Error Handling: REST typically provides less error handling capabilities than SOAP, which can make it less reliable in some situations."
